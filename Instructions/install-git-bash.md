## Integrating with VS Code

Git Bash is already integrated with VS Code as one of the available terminals

##  Here's how to access it:

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. In the terminal section, located at the top right of the window, you'll see a dropdown arrow to the right of the "+" icon.
3. Click on the dropdown arrow to reveal the list of available terminals.
4. You'll find Git Bash listed there. Click on it to open a Git Bash terminal within VS Code.

That's it! You've successfully set up Git Bash and integrated it with Visual Studio Code.
